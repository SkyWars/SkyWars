bowman:
  # This kit has a cost of $100. The cost is charged every game in which it is used.
  cost: 100
  items:
    # You can list any number of items here.
    # Each item has a type section. It also may optionally have an enchantments
    # section and amount value.
    # The type is a material name. You can get a list of these here:
    # https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html
    - {type: ARROW, amount: 16}
    # When amount is not given, it defaults to 1.
    - {type: BOW}

  cost: 20
  items:
    - {type: STICK, enchantments: {KNOCKBACK: 3},
        name: "Whacking Stick", lore: ["&2Whacking", "&4and hacking"]}
potions:
  # This kit demonstrates how to enter potions into kits.
  cost: 100
  items:
    # Potions:
    # There are two ways to add potions to an item:
    #
    # Using `potion: {TYPE, extended: true/false, splash: true/false, level: 1/2}`
    # will turn the item into one of the set potions in minecraft, and update the
    # item name and lore accordingly. TYPE in this case is a PotionType, see links below.
    #
    # You can also add "custom" potion effects, using:
    # `extra-effects: [{type: TYPE, duration: SECONDS, amplifier: AMPLIFIER}, {type: TYPE2, ...}]`
    # For extra-effects, TYPE is a PotionEffectType, see the links below. SECONDS is how long it
    # will last, AMPLIFIER is similar to a potion level, but can go up to 128. amplifier: 0
    # represents the default effects, and is the default value.
    #
    # When adding custom potion effects, it is recommended to still have one "regular" potion set.
    # Even if you override it with a custom effect, it will allow the item's name and lore to
    # update for the potion it holds.

    # this is a drinkable invisibility potion
    - {type: POTION, amount: 2, potion: {type: INVISIBILITY}}
    # this potion is a double edged sword - it gives speed, and poison.
    # however, the speed lasts a bit longer than the poison does.
    - {type: POTION, amount: 2, potion: {type: SPEED, splash: true},
                          extra-effects: [
                            # this will overwrite the main speed effect, while allowing the text to remain.
                            # I honestly have no idea what this duration is counted in.
                            {type: SPEED, duration: 2000},
                            {type: POISON, duration: 1000}
                          ]}
    # Full heal - the higher the amplifier, the more effect it has.
